This is the most basic version,

I've just written a demo with the login registration function,

The server uses a epoll single threaded model,

Is a simple, stable server model,

But we tried to select server designs for some other models,for learning.

The main problems I encountered in writing this were the using of JSONcpp,mysql,and using C++ provided encapsulation and realized interfaces.

I am deeply aware that encapsulation is not a simple matter.

The header files and makefile files needed to compile are stored under the this repository.

Your valuable opinions are welcome!
